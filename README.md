In Marble Madness, the player starts out a new game with three lives and continues to
play until all of his/her lives have been exhausted. There are multiple levels in Marble
Madness, beginning with level 0, and each level has its own maze. During each level, the
player must gather all of the blue crystals within the current maze before the exit is
revealed and they may use it to move on to the next level.
Upon starting each level, the player’s avatar is placed in a maze filled with one or more
blue crystals, marbles, pits, robots, robot factories and other goodies. The player may use
the arrow keys to move their avatar (the Indiana Jones-looking character) left, right, up
and down through the maze. They may walk on any square so long as it doesn’t have a
wall, a marble, a factory, a robot, or a pit on it. The player may walk onto a square
containing a marble if they are able to push it out of the way first. In addition to walking
around the maze, the player may also shoot their pea cannon – but beware, it has only
limited peas. Peas can destroy robots as well as marbles, but it takes more than one shot
to do so.

There are three different types of goodies distributed throughout the maze that the player
can collect in addition to blue crystals. If the player’s avatar steps upon the same square
as an extra life goodie, it instantly gives the player an extra life. If the avatar steps onto
the same square as a restore health goodie, it will restore the player to full health (in case
of having been injured by shots from the robots). Finally, if the avatar steps onto the same
square as an ammo goodie, it will give the player 20 additional peas.
There are four major types of robots in Marble Madness: Horizontal RageBots, Vertical
RageBots, Regular ThiefBots and Mean ThiefBots
As mentioned, RageBots fall into two categories – Horizontal RageBots and Vertical
RageBots. Horizonal RageBots simply move back and forth on a row of the screen (only
reversing course when they run into an obstacle), shooting at the player’s avatar if he/she
ever walks in their line of sight. Vertical RageBots are identical to their Horizontal
cousins, but move up and down within a single column of the maze. RageBots can start
out anywhere in the maze (depending on where the designer of the maze choses to put
them).

In contrast to the RageBot, the ThiefBots are a bit nastier. These robots wander around
the maze looking for goodies to steal. If they happen to step onto a goodie (an extra life
goodie, a restore health goodie, or an ammo goodie) and they don’t already hold one,
they may pick it up for themselves. As with RageBots, there are two types of ThiefBots:
Regular ThiefBots and Mean ThiefBots. Regular ThiefBots simply wander aimlessly
around the maze looking for, and picking up, goodies. They are otherwise harmless and
will not fire upon the player’s avatar. In contrast, in addition to picking up goodies, Mean
ThiefBots will fire a pea anytime the player steps in their path. So beware! When any
type of ThiefBot dies, if it previously picked up a goodie, it will drop this object upon its
square in the maze.

ThiefBots are created by ThiefBot factories, of which there are two types – one that
produces Regular ThiefBots and one that produces Mean ThiefBots. ThiefBots never
start out in the maze; they are added only by factories.
Once the player has collected all of the blue crystals within the current maze, an exit will
appear. The exit is invisible and unusable until all of the crystals have been collected
from the level. Once the exit has been revealed, the player must direct their avatar to the
exit in order to advance to the next level. The player will be granted 2000 points for
exiting a level. The player will also be given a bonus for completing the level quickly, if
they did so fast enough. The game is complete once the player has used the exit on the
last level!
